# Micro Frontend App With module federation
This is full sample of Micro Frontend App with module federation.
This sample is an exercise and some components are fully copy-pasted. 

## Approach
In this sample, we are using module federation with webpack configuration.
Also this is mono repo project and we should have CI/CD configuration in the root folder, so If you see that is doesn't work for your company, you should separate each project and make it multi repo.

## Alternatives

* Use native federation
* Multi Repo 
* Use vite federation not just webpack
